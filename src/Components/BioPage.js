            <p>My name is Kae, pronounced kay. As of today, February 17, 2022, we are nearing 2 years of
            the Covid pandemic which has changed the world from sanitation
            practices to cultural etiquettes. In the city of San Francisco,
            bars and restaurants, have expanded their spaces to include parklets,
            moved tables to be 6ft apart, and/or set up physical barriers between 
            restaurants. Patrons are required to wear masks indoor while ordering,
            or walking around the establishment. Observationally and culturally, 
            people have fluxtuated between being more or less inclined to hugs 
            and handshakes due to the pandemic.
