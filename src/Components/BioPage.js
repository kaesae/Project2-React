                <p>Hey there,</p>
                <p>{' '}</p>
                <p>My name is Kae, pronounced kay. As of today, February 17, 2022, 
                we are nearing 2 years of the Covid pandemic which has changed the
                world from sanitation practices to cultural etiquettes. In the city
                of San Francisco, bars and restaurants have expanded their spaces to include parklets,
                moved tables to be 6ft apart, and/or set up physical barriers between 
                tables. Patrons are required to wear a mask indoor while ordering,
                or walking around the establishment. Observationally and culturally, 
                people have fluxtuated between being more or less inclined to hugs 
                and handshakes due to the pandemic.
                <p>{' '}</p>
                I, myself, transformed into the social butterfly I am today as my friends 
                put it, changed careers, and I've started feeling rooted, making San Francisco
                my home base. So despite all that has happened, I feel as though I've changed
                for the better.
